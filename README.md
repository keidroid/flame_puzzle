# Project details

## Inspiration
A retro game I played when I was a boy. Developed with the latest Flutter game engine Flame.

## What it does
- Works on iOS, Android, and the Web
- Multi Resolution (160x144~)
- Sound playback (BGM, SE, Jingle)
- Tap, mouse, and key input
- Timer display
- Extra bird animation ðŸ•Š

## How we built it
Re-created using the game engine Flame

## Challenges we ran into
- Widget to be arranged to support other devices
- Playback of sound became heavy.
- Creating game-like screens

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- Lightness of movement, including slides
- Game-like screen (All pixel art was created!)

## What we learned
- How to use Flame
  - Multiple inputs (tap, key, mouse)
  - Tween animation, flip-book animation
- Dealing with slowdowns
  - Multi-device support for Flutter
- How to show pixel art well in Flutter

## What's next for Retro Slide Puzzle Game
- Operation in iPhone Safari
- Add test using Flame
